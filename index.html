    <h1>introduction</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Nabil Syah Azmi. I am 15 years old, 
        I was born in medan on the 13th of june 2008.</p>

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I live with with my parents and three siblings, 
    I go to school at SMK Letris Indonesia 2 majoring in software engineering.</p>

    <h1>Why i chose Letris and majored in software engineering.</h1>
    <p>It was one of the main high school that came into my mind,
        and I was also too lazy to browse for schools near me.
        so I chose the closest and the only one i know, and it's also where
        my sister and my brother went.
    </p>

    <p>I majored in software engineering because of my brothers sugestion, and its not just 
        becauseof his pressure, i was also curious of the world of codes and computers, wanted to make my own game too,
         so i took his sugestion and majored in software engineering, the class is cool, lots of interesting
         people, and some <b>unique</b> individuals.
    </p>
